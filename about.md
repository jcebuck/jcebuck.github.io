Hi, my name is James and I've been interested in computers for most of my life, and programming them since I was a teenager.

Since then my interests have grown into other areas such as cyber security and reverse engineering, and I have enjoyed taking part in a number of competitions/hackathons with other like-minded people.

In 2015 I graduated from the University of Southampton in the UK with a BSc in Computer Science, and am now currently working as a software developer.

Through this blog, I hope to share some of the things that I've learnt, and meet many others with similar interests to me!
